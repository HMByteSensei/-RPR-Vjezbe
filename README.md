## Tutorial 4: File Handling and Data Persistence for a Laptop Management 

This tutorial serves to teach me how to implement robust **file handling techniques, including serialization, JSON, and XML parsing** in Java, to enable persistent storage and retrieval of laptop data within a management system.

**Branch:** `lab4-z1` (both tasks are implemented in this branch)

### Prerequisite

To begin, create a Maven project named `lv4-z1` using Command Prompt. Within the `ba.unsa.etf.rpr` package, create the following:

#### Laptop Class

Create a `Laptop` class adhering to the JavaBeans specification, with attributes:
- brand (String)
- model (String)
- price (double)
- ram (int)
- hdd (int)
- ssd (int)
- processor (String)
- graphicsCard (String)
- screen size (double)

#### LaptopDao Interface

Define an interface `LaptopDao` with the following methods:
- `addLaptopToList(Laptop laptop)`
- `addLaptopToFile(Laptop laptop)`
- `getLaptop(String processor)`
- `populateList(ArrayList<Laptop> laptops)`
- `retrieveDataFromFile()`

## Task 1

Implement the following classes: `LaptopDaoSerializableFile`, `LaptopDaoJSONFile`, `LaptopDaoXMLFile`. Each class should implement the `LaptopDao` interface and have attributes: `file` (File) and `laptops` (ArrayList<Laptop>).

- `LaptopDaoSerializableFile`: Implements storing laptops in a .txt file using classes for binary file operations.
- `LaptopDaoJSONFile`: Stores laptops in a .json file using the ObjectMapper class.
- `LaptopDaoXMLFile`: Stores laptops in a .xml file using the XMLMapper class.

Ensure to add the appropriate dependencies in the `pom.xml` file for handling .json and .xml files. The method `addLaptopToFile(Laptop laptop)` should append the laptop parameter to the file without overwriting existing objects of type Laptop already present in the file upon program execution.

The method `getLaptop(String processor)` should return a Laptop object with the specified processor. If no such object exists, it should throw a `NoSuchProcessorException`.

The method `populateList(ArrayList<Laptop> laptops)` assigns the value to the laptops attribute.

The method `retrieveDataFromFile()` should return a list of Laptop objects read from the file.

Include a small test program for each of these file handling classes.

### Task 2

Write JUnit 5 tests for Task 1. Ensure to use Mocking at least once and provide a brief comment explaining the use of Mocking in that particular case.

### Note

- Ensure commits are atomic.
- Provide explanations for the use of Mocking in your comments.
- Push the exercise to GitHub upon completion.

## Tutorial 7 and 8: JavaFX User Management Application

### Summary
These tutorials focus on developing a JavaFX application for user management, utilizing JavaFX Beans, properties, and models. The application includes features for adding, editing, and displaying user information in a responsive UI.

**Branches:** `lv7-z1`, `lv7-z2`, `lv7i8-z3`, `lv7i8-z4`

**How it looks:**
<div style="display: inline-block">
    <img src="https://github.com/HMByteSensei/Software-Engineering/blob/main/Images/Task7i8.png?raw=true" alt="Image 1" style="width: 30%;">
</div>

<div style="display: inline-block">
    <img src="https://github.com/HMByteSensei/Software-Engineering/blob/main/Images/New%20user%20added.png?raw=true" alt="Image 2" style="width: 30%;">
</div>

**Task 1:**
- **Description:** Create a new JavaFX project with a user interface for adding and editing users as depicted in the provided image. The left side contains a ListView of users, and the right side has fields for name, surname, email, username, and password. Selecting a user in the list should populate the form fields automatically. Add functionality to add a new user with empty fields and close the program when finished.
- **Additional Requirements:** Use property binding and CSS for layout styling. Ensure proper spacing and responsiveness to window resizing.

**Task 2:**
- **Description:** Implement a class named `Korisnik` as a JavaFX Bean, containing all necessary fields for the application from Zadatak 1. Use Property types (e.g., SimpleStringProperty instead of String) and provide getter and setter methods.

**Task 3:**
- **Description:** Create a `KorisniciModel` class representing the model component for the application. The class should include an ObservableArrayList for users and a SimpleObjectProperty for the currently selected user. Implement a method `napuni` to populate the user list with specified data. Add a constructor to `Korisnik` that takes String parameters instead of SimpleStringProperty parameters for ease of use.

**Zadatak 4:**
- **Description:** Add a method in the `Controller` class with the following definition:
  ```java
  @FXML
  public void initialize() {
  }
- In this method, perform two-way binding for each form field with the corresponding user's property as shown in the example:
  ```java
  listKorisnici.setItems(model.getKorisnici());
 - Bind the ListView control to the list of users:
   ```java
   listKorisnici.setItems(model.getKorisnici());
  - Verify the contents of the user list after running the program. If the list content is unexpected, override the toString method in the Korisnik class as defined in the example.

**Task 5:**

Description: Implement functionality for the "Dodaj" button. When clicked, add a new user with empty fields using the KorisniciModel class method. Set this new user as the current user, triggering all previously implemented changes. Add JUnit 5 tests to test the model class and TestFX tests to test the user interface.

## Tutorial 9: Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) with DAO Pattern

### Summary
This tutorial focuses on creating a Java application with Maven that interacts with a database using JDBC and the DAO (Data Access Object) pattern. The application manages cities and countries data, including CRUD operations and database initialization.

**Branch:** `lab9`

**Prerequisites:**
- Create a new Maven project containing a blank console application.
- Set up a database with two tables:
  - Table `city` with columns: id (int, primary key), name (text), population (int), country_id (int, foreign key).
  - Table `country` with columns: id (int, primary key), name (text), capital_id (int, foreign key).
- Use any preferred database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, Oracle) and an environment of choice for database creation (e.g., DBBrowser for SQLite, MySQL Workbench, SQLTools). Export the database to a file `database.db` and include this file in your IntelliJ project.

**Task 1:**
- **Description:** Implement the `GeographyDAO` class with corresponding DTO classes `City` and `Country`. `GeographyDAO` should be a singleton class. Its constructor should establish a connection and prepare all necessary queries.
- **Method:** Implement the `getCities()` method in `GeographyDAO` to return an `ArrayList<City>` of all cities in the database, sorted by population in descending order.

**Task 2:**
- **Description:** Modify `GeographyDAO` to populate the database with data for cities: Paris, London, Vienna, Manchester, and Graz, and their respective countries if the `database.db` file does not exist.

**Task 3:**
- **Description:** Enhance `GeographyDAO` with CRUD operations:
  - `City getCapital(String country)` - returns null if the country does not exist, otherwise returns the capital city of that country from the database.
  - `void deleteCountry(String country)` - deletes the country from the database, including all cities in that country.
  - `ArrayList<City> getCities()` - returns a list of cities from the database, sorted by population in descending order.
  - `void addCity(City city)` - adds a new city to the database.
  - `void addCountry(Country country)` - adds a new country to the database.
  - `void updateCity(City city)` - updates the corresponding row in the database for the given city.
  - `Country findCountry(String country)` - returns null if the country does not exist, otherwise returns the country from the database.

**Task 4:**
- **Description:** Implement program logic to use the above classes and interact with the database within a console application.
- **Main Class:** Include the following static methods:
  - `String printCities()` - calls the `getCities()` method and returns a string with data in the format: "City Name (Country Name) - Population".
  - `void mainCity()` - allows the user to enter the name of a country via keyboard input and then prints a message in the format: "The capital of country Country Name is City Name". If the country does not exist in the database, print: "Non-existent country".

## Tutorials 10 and 11: JavaFX Application with Database Interaction

### Summary
These tutorials focus on creating a JavaFX application that interacts with a database using JDBC and implements CRUD operations. The application manages cities and countries data through a graphical user interface (GUI) with forms for adding, editing, and deleting data.

**Branches:** `lab10-z1i2`, `lab10-z3`, `lab10-z4NITI`, `lab10-z5testovi`

### Prerequisites
- Create a new JavaFX project and copy the classes `City`, `Country`, and `GeographyDAO` from Lab Exercise 9, which were previously validated within the `main` function. These classes will be used for database access in Labs 10 and 11.

### Task 1: Design Forms for Database Interaction
1. **glavna.fxml Form:**
   - This form should open when the program starts.
   - Contains a TableView (fx:id "tableViewGradovi") with columns: ID (colGradId), Name (colGradNaziv), Population (colGradStanovnika), Country (colGradDrzava).
   - On the right side, a vertical row of buttons: "Add City" (btnDodajGrad), "Add Country" (btnDodajDrzavu), "Edit City" (btnIzmijeniGrad), "Delete City" (btnObrisiGrad).

2. **drzava.fxml Form:**
   - Opens upon clicking the "Add Country" button.
   - Contains a standard data entry form for adding country data:
     - TextField "Name" (fx:id fieldNaziv)
     - ChoiceBox "Capital City" (fx:id choiceGrad)
     - ButtonBar with "Ok" and "Cancel" buttons (btnOk and btnCancel).
     - The Cancel button closes the window without any changes, while the Ok button validates the fieldNaziv.

3. **grad.fxml Form:**
   - Opens upon clicking the "Add City" or "Edit City" button.
   - Contains a standard data entry form with fields:
     - TextField "Name" (fx:id fieldNaziv)
     - TextField "Population" (fx:id fieldBrojStanovnika)
     - ChoiceBox "Country" (fx:id choiceDrzava)
     - ButtonBar with "Ok" and "Cancel" buttons (btnOk and btnCancel).
     - Optionally, add validation for the "Name" field to ensure it is not empty, and for the "Population" field to require a positive integer (changing color as shown in the image).

### Task 2: Create Controllers and MVC Pattern
- Implement `GlavnaController`, `DrzavaController`, and `GradController`.
- Instead of using the `GeografijaDAO` class, create static lists for cities and countries to store data (do not use the Model class).
- Refactor `City` and `Country` to follow the JavaFX Beans specification.
- Implement bidirectional control linking (MVC) as in Labs 7 and 8 to enable adding new cities/countries, editing existing ones, deleting cities/countries, and displaying all cities within the three previously created forms.

### Task 3: Data Persistence with GeografijaDAO
- Replace static lists of cities and countries with instances of the `GeografijaDAO` class.
- If `GeografijaDAO` does not have methods needed for application functionality (e.g., updating city, deleting country), add appropriate database interaction methods.

### Task 4: Database Initialization
- Clear all existing entries in the `city` and `country` tables at the beginning of the program.
- Populate both tables with predefined cities and countries.
- Use two methods running synchronously in separate threads to delete all entries from both tables concurrently. Ensure proper synchronization to avoid deadlocks.

### Task 5: Unit Testing with JUnit
- Create JUnit tests for `GeografijaDAO` functionalities.
- Implement two types of tests:
  1. Tests that consider the order of execution and the current state of the database.
  2. Tests that reset the database state, ensuring they can run independently of other tests.

### Task 6: Adding Database Constraints
- Apply appropriate constraints to columns in the `city` and `country` database tables (e.g., name and population fields, primary and foreign keys).
- Implement try-catch blocks in the `GeografijaDAO` class to prevent data entry violations without causing unhandled exceptions.
- Communicate errors to the user through UI elements such as TextField control messages, Alert dialogs (help link: [JavaFX Alerts and Dialogs](https://thecodinginterface.com/blog/javafx-alerts-and-dialogs/)), or other suitable methods.
